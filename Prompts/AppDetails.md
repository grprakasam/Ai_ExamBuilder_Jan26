# Goal

This AI-powered educational ecosystem enables students to generate comprehensive assessments and corresponding answer keys for defined topics. By leveraging state-of-the-art Large Language Models, the platform democratizes personalized tutoring and rigorous self-assessment.

Through the advanced power of AI, this app will:
- **Automate Content Synthesis**: Transform raw study materials into structured examinations across various formats (MCQs, open-ended, and case studies).
- **Enable Adaptive Difficulty**: Dynamically calibrate question complexity based on real-time student performance to maintain an optimal "Zone of Proximal Development."
- **Synthesize Contextual Explanations**: Provide deep-dive rationales for correct and incorrect answers to reinforce conceptual mastery.
- **Analyze Multimodal Inputs**: Process diagrams, handwritten notes, and

# Scope
 
- **Global Examination Coverage**: Support a diverse range of standardized and competitive assessments across the United States and India, including K-12 state standards (e.g., NCDPI), national boards (e.g., CBSE, ICSE), state-level examinations (e.g., TN Govt), and high-stakes entrance tests (e.g., SAT, ACT, JEE, NEET).
- **Curriculum Alignment**: Map assessment generation to specific regional frameworks and learning outcomes, ensuring pedagogical relevance across different educational jurisdictions.



## Design Principles & Educational Impact
- **Automated Solution Key Synthesis**: Generate high-fidelity answer keys and marking schemes that integrate deep-dive rationales for every assessment.
- **AI-Driven Diagnostic Precision**: Identify idiosyncratic learning gaps through granular performance mapping and predictive diagnostic testing.
- **Actionable Progress Visualization**: Transform raw performance data into high-fidelity interactive dashboards, providing real-time visibility into student growth.
- **Instant Rubric-Based Feedback**: Deliver immediate, objective evaluations based on standardized rubrics to facilitate rapid cognitive correction and mastery.
- **Peer-to-Peer Evaluative Heuristics**: Orchestrate collaborative review cycles to cultivate critical thinking, communication skills, and evaluative judgment.


### Implementation Strategy & Best Practices
- **Modular Architecture**: Decouple the assessment engine from reporting services for independent scalability.
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure FERPA and GDPR compliance with end-to-end encryption for student records.
- **Accessibility**: Adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards to provide an inclusive experience for all learners.
- **API-First Design**: Develop robust RESTful APIs to facilitate third-party integrations and data portability.
- **Scalability**: Utilize cloud-native auto-scaling to handle high traffic during peak examination periods.


**Pricing**

pilot- free
 next level - paid

 **Rules**
 Inside the app, avoid the word "ai" anywhere.
 It must look like the actual exam paper and feel like the actual exam paper.
The terminology used must be exam -aligned terminology.

**Authentication flow**


there will be a page named ""Authentication Code"" : it has the following features:

this tracks all the test ids generated by the system while each user creates a test

it mandates the user to enter the following details to access the question paper for the test created by them:
    mail id
    TEST ID
    6 digit plain code

 the master code  is unique to the test id

 test id is known to the user ; 6 digit code is given by the syste and available in the system 



user email + TEST ID +PLAIN CODE 6 digit word   => KEY FOR THE USER   to enter the exam mode




Currenly not using the USER ID , LOGIN CREDENTIALS method

ACCESS TO QNS ONLY AFTER THE AUTHENTHENTICATION

TEST ID VISIBLE TO THEM; CODE BY US

-----------------------------------

how many times the code shall be used

Allow exam only if the master code or unique allowed in our db is entered ; else dont allow for exams
