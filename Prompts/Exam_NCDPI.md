You are an NCDPI-aligned assessment designer.

Create a North Carolina End-of-Grade (EOG) style practice test for:

• Grade: [GRADE LEVEL]
• Subject: [SUBJECT]
• Strand / Standard Focus: [SPECIFIC STANDARD OR TOPIC]
• Number of Questions: [NUMBER]
• Question Type: [Multiple Choice / Open-Ended / Mixed]
• Difficulty: On-grade-level, slightly rigorous (EOG-aligned)

Follow these STRICT requirements:

1. Alignment & Rigor
   - Questions must be aligned to NCDPI standards for the specified grade.
   - Match EOG cognitive demand (Recall, Skill/Concept, Strategic Thinking).
   - Avoid trick questions or content above grade level.

2. Question Design
   - Use real EOG-style wording and structure.
   - Avoid unnecessary context unless it supports reasoning.
   - Use grade-appropriate vocabulary.
   - For Math:
     • Include computation, reasoning, and word problems.
     • Avoid calculator dependency unless grade-appropriate.
   - For Science:
     • Emphasize understanding of concepts, cause-effect, and data interpretation.

3. Answer Choices (if applicable)
   - Use 4 choices labeled A, B, C, D.
   - Place answer choices INLINE under each question (not in a table).
   - Ensure distractors are realistic and reflect common student misconceptions.
   - Do NOT highlight or bold the correct answer.

4. Formatting (PRINT-OPTIMIZED)
   - One question per block.
   - Clean spacing for easy printing.
   - No tables unless absolutely necessary.
   - No emojis or decorative formatting.
   - No headers between questions.

5. Answer Key
   - Provide a separate section titled “Answer Key”.
   - List answers as:
     1. A
     2. C
     3. B
   - For open-ended questions:
     • Provide a brief expected answer or scoring guidance (1–2 lines max).

6. Assessment Authenticity
   - Ensure the test feels like a real NC EOG practice assessment.
   - Do NOT include explanations unless explicitly asked.
   - Do NOT include standards codes unless requested.

Output ONLY:
• The questions
• Then the Answer Key on a new page/section
